# road-to-glory-leetcode
My journey of LeetCoding
I borrowed the phrase Road to Glory from FIFA, where it refers to building an awesome team through grinding and starting from nothing. 

20. Valid Parentheses - Just thought I should do a string question. I used stack, but I saw a very interesting solution that calls replace on paretheses repeatedly. July 25, 21
62. Unique Paths - I used dp with 2D array but it can be improved using only one array/vector.  July 25, 21
63. Unique Paths II - I modified the given matrix but I probably shouldn't have. July 25, 21
111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree - I used recursion (DFS), and also BFS to see if it's faster. My BFS solution was only slightly faster than my recursion solution. (220ms and 224ms) July 25, 21
114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List - I used recursion but I saw a better solution using iteration that always go to the right most leaf of the left child. July 25, 21
